## RealistikOsu Shared Code
This is shared code between RealistikOsu's score server (lets) and Bancho (pep.py). It's used to share common functions so rewriting the same things multiple times in different servers isn't required. It is based Ripple's common code (https://zxq.co/ripple/ripple-python-common) with modifications to allow the relax and autopilot gamemodes.
